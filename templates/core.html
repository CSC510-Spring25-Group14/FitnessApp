        <p id="1" style="color: white;"><br> Develop a strong core for more than the six-pack abs that will hopefully peak through. Use core conditioning to improve your overall athletic performance and lifeâ€”the flat abs are just a bonus. <br><br><strong style="font-size: 25px;color: #FFC107;">Main Practice:</strong><br><br><strong>1. Plank: </strong>Maintaining a straight, rigid body position, supported by your forearms and toes, challenges the entire core. It is a fundamental core exercise that targets not only the abdominal muscles but also the back and shoulders. <br><strong>2. Reverse Crunch:</strong> Lie on your back on a mat, with your hands placed either by your sides or underneath your lower back for support. Keep your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Lift your feet off the floor and bring your knees towards your chest until your hips are slightly off the ground. At this starting position, your thighs should be perpendicular to the floor, and your calves should be parallel to the floor and perform the crunch.<br><strong>3. Bird Dog Crunch: </strong>Begin on all fours in a tabletop position. Keep your hands directly under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Your back should be flat, and your head and neck should be in a neutral position. Extend one arm straight forward and the opposite leg straight back, forming a straight line from your extended hand to your extended foot. Keep your hips and shoulders square to the groundand perform crunch.<br><strong>4. Glute Bridge: </strong> Lie on your back on a mat or the floor. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart. Your arms should be at your sides with palms down. Engage your core and glutes to lift your hips off the ground, forming a straight line from your knees to your shoulders. Be careful not to hyperextend your lower back.<br><strong>5. Russian Twist: </strong>Sitting on the floor, lean back slightly with your legs either on the ground or lifted for more intensity. Twist your torso from side to side, optionally holding a weight for added resistance.<br><br><br></p>
